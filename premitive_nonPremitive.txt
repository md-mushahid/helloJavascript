# Primitive data types are immutable, which means their values cannot be changed 
  once they are created.
# They are stored directly in memory, and their values are accessed by their actual value.

# There are six primitive data types in JavaScript: 

  1. undefined: Represents an uninitialized variable or missing property.
  2. null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
  3. boolean: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
  4. number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
  5. string: Represents a sequence of characters, enclosed within single quotes ('') 
     or double quotes ("").
  6. symbol (added in ECMAScript 6): Represents a unique and immutable value 
     used as the key of an object property.


# Non-primitive data types are mutable, which means their values can be changed 
   after they are created.
# They are stored by reference in memory, and their values are accessed by reference.

# There are three non-primitive data types in JavaScript:

  1. object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs where keys are strings (or symbols) 
     and values can be of any data type, including other objects.
  2. function: Represents executable code, usually associated with an object.
  3. array: A special type of object that represents a list of elements, with numeric indices 
     starting from 0.
